# SignalFx Tracing Library for Go

The SignalFx Tracing Library for Go helps you automatically instrument
Go applications with instrumented library helpers and a tracer to capture
and report distributed traces to SignalFx. You can also use the library to
manually instrument Go applications with the OpenTracing API.

## Requirements and supported software

These are the requirements to use the SignalFx Tracing Library for Go:

* Go 1.12+
* `mod` or `dep` dependency management tool

These are the supported libraries you can instrument:

| Library | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| [database/sql](contrib/database/sql) | Standard Library |
| [gin-gonic/gin](contrib/gin-gonic/gin) | 1.5.0 |
| [globalsign/mgo](contrib/globalsign/mgo) | r2018.06.15+ |
| [gorilla/mux](contrib/gorilla/mux) | 1.7+ |
| [labstack/echo](contrib/labstack/echo) | 4.0+ |
| [mongodb/mongo-go-driver](contrib/mongodb/mongo-go-driver) | 1.0+ |
| [net/http](contrib/net/http) | Standard Library |

Other libraries are available to instrument, but are in beta and aren't
officially supported. You can view all the libraries in the
[contrib](contrib) directory.

## Configuration values

If the default configuration values don't apply for your environment, override them before running the process you instrument.

| Code | Environment Variable | Default Value | Notes |
| ---  | ---                  | ---           | ---   |
| [WithServiceName](https://godoc.org/github.com/signalfx/signalfx-go-tracing/tracing/#WithServiceName) | `SIGNALFX_SERVICE_NAME` | `SignalFx-Tracing` | The name of the service. |
| [WithEndpointURL](https://godoc.org/github.com/signalfx/signalfx-go-tracing/tracing/#WithEndpointURL) | `SIGNALFX_ENDPOINT_URL` | `http://localhost:9080/v1/trace` | The URL to send traces to. Send spans to a Smart Agent, OpenTelemetry Collector, or a SignalFx ingest endpoint.  |
| [WithAccessToken](https://godoc.org/github.com/signalfx/signalfx-go-tracing/tracing/#WithAccessToken) | `SIGNALFX_ACCESS_TOKEN` | none | The access token for your SignalFx organization. |
| [WithGlobalTag](https://godoc.org/github.com/signalfx/signalfx-go-tracing/tracing/#WithGlobalTag) | `SIGNALFX_SPAN_TAGS` | none | Comma-separated list of tags included in every reported span. For example, "key1:val1,key2:val2". Use only string values for tags.|

## Instrument a Go application

Follow these steps to instrument target libraries with provided instrumentors. 

For more information about how to instrument a Go application, see the
[examples](https://github.com/signalfx/tracing-examples/tree/master/signalfx-tracing/signalfx-go-tracing).

1. Import `github.com/signalfx/signalfx-go-tracing` to your `go mod` or `dep`
dependencies.
2. Import the instrumentor for the target library you want to instrument and
replace utilities with their traced equivalents. 

   Find an instrumentor for each supported target library in the [contrib](contrib)
   directory. Each instrumentor has an `example_test.go` file that demonstrates
   how to instrument a target library. Don't import examples directly in your application.
3. Enable tracing globally with
[tracing.Start()](https://godoc.org/github.com/signalfx/signalfx-go-tracing/tracing/#Start).
This creates a tracer and registers it as the OpenTracing global tracer. 

## API

See the SignalFx Tracing Library for Go API on
[godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/signalfx/signalfx-go-tracing/tracing).

## Testing

Test locally using the Go toolset. The grpc.v12 integration will fail because
it covers for deprecated methods. This is expected. In the CI environment we
vendor this version of the library inside the integration. Under normal
circumstances this is not something that we want to do, because users using
this integration might be running versions different from the vendored one,
creating hard to debug conflicts.

To run integration tests locally, you should set the `INTEGRATION` environment
variable. The dependencies of the integration tests are best run via Docker.
To get an idea about the versions and the set-up take a look at our
[CI config](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-go-tracing/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml).

The best way to run the entire test suite is using the
[CircleCI CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-jobs/). Simply run
`circleci build` in the repository root. Note that you might have to increase
the resources dedicated to Docker to around 4GB.
