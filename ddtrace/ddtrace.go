// Package ddtrace contains the interfaces that specify the implementations of Datadog's
// tracing library, as well as a set of sub-packages containing various implementations:
// our native implementation ("tracer"), a wrapper that can be used with Opentracing
// ("opentracer") and a mock tracer to be used for testing ("mocktracer"). Additionally,
// package "ext" provides a set of tag names and values specific to Datadog's APM product.
//
// To get started, visit the documentation for any of the packages you'd like to begin
